Fictional Company Landing Page
This project is a landing page for a fictional company featuring CSS animations and responsiveness using media queries.

Design Choices:
Color Scheme: The color scheme, carefully selected to consist of shades of black, white, and gray, creates a professional and modern look for the company.
Typography: The default font family used is Google Fonts' "Allerta Stencil," a clean and widely supported font.
Layout: The layout includes a navigation bar at the top, a header, content sections, and a footer, providing a structured and organized presentation.
Responsiveness: Media queries ensure the design adapts to various screen sizes, offering an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

How to View the Project:
Open the `passion.html` file in a web browser to view the landing page. To fully appreciate the responsiveness of the design, experiment with resizing the browser window or viewing the page on different devices.
